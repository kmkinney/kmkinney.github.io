		<h2>What is the Flag Service?</h2>
		<p>We will plant a flag outside your home 6 DAYS A YEAR for $40

Unless otherwise noted below, the flag will go in the area of grass directly across from your mailbox on the other side of the sidewalk from your front lawn.

Already have a flag? Purchase this service  for a neighbor and put their address down below as well as marking so on the question indicated.

Your help is greatly appreciated!
